=head1 Security

B<NOTE:> You must be the superuser to run this script.

B<WARNING:> This script contains security info.
Do not set world-readable. Better yet, redesign
so that security information is not saved
in your source code.

This script does not need root/superuser/administrator
permission to function.

This script does not contain any security info.

=head1 Examples

Multiple input files are valid, I<e.g.>,

 B<E<lt>script_nameE<gt>> -i file1 --input=file2 file3 file4 file5

A single output file is valid, I<e.g.>,

 B<E<lt>script_nameE<gt>> -i file1 -o output.file

Insert instructive examples here.



=head1 Notes & Caveats


=head2 Warning: Input file and Output File Restriction

Do not use the same file as an input and output in the same command of B<E<lt>script_nameE<gt>>. You will
destroy your data. B<E<lt>script_nameE<gt>> checks for --input and --output being equal; however,
you should not do

E<0x10062> script_name --input=file_one >file_one E<0x10062>
