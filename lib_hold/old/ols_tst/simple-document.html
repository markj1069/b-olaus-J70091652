1.1 Formatting
==============

Similar to chapters, sections must have the same name and appear in the
same order.

1.1.1 This is a subsection title
--------------------------------

1.1.1.1 This is a sub-subsection title
......................................

Each block of text is a paragraph.  You can use multiple lines for the
paragraph like so, only empty lines separate paragraphs.

   Common formatting include _emphasis_, ‘inline code’.  Specific type
of text can be marked as well: ‘file.txt’, ‘--learn-fast’, ‘ls’ or
VARIABLE.  You can escape the command character like so: @, and a
newline with a single @ at the end of the line.

   You can add different types of blocks:

     Here is an example

     '(this is lisp code)

   • An element in an unordered list
   • A second element in the same list

  1. This list is similar
  2. But ordered

     A quotation block, by someone famous maybe

element title
     element description

second element title
     second element description.  Note that the description part can
     span multiple paragraphs, contain other blocks etc.  This is
     usually used as a definition list.

     ‘@asis’ wraps the element title, and tells Texinfo to use them
     as-is.

‘do-x’
     This item title is now wrapped in a code block, as in ‘x’

 -- Kind of Function: function_name ARG1 ARG2
     ARG3 ARG4 [OPTIONAL5] This text describes the function.  Note how
     we could use multiple lines for the function synopsis by escaping
     the line with a single @.

     This again can contain multiple paragraphs or blocks.

1.2 Links
=========

There are various types of links you can use.  A simple link to a URL
with <https://github.com> and optionally with it a title: GitHub
(https://github.com).  An email address <me@me.me>.  A node in this
document, *Note Introduction::.  Always use the exact node name for that
one.  ‘xref’ will include the text “see” before the link.  To insert
something different, use *note Introduction:: (“See”) or *Note
Introduction:: (nothing is inserted).  With an additional argument, you
can change the text of the link, *Note this introduction: Introduction.

   It is possible to link to external manuals with these commands by
adding more arguments, as in , *Note (texinfo)Overview:: for the
complete reference on Texinfo!
