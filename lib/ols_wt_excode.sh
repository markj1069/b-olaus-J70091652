=head1 NAME

B<ols_wt_excode> - Write Olaus Exit Code to temporary file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ols_wt_excode> I<EX_CODE>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ols_wt_excode> writes the Olaus Exit Code, I<EX_CODE> to a temporary file with the name $OLS_EX_FILE.

The Olaus Bash Library uses temporary files to simulate global variables.

=head1 EXAMPLE

    ols_wt_excode $OLS_EXCODE

=head1 NOTES & CAVEATS

B<Note:> Due to the behavior of the C<printf> command,
EX_CODE should not have a leading zero.
If it does,
the value will be converted to octal, I<e.g.>,
'064' will be converted to ' 52'.
